Version 1.0 \
Deployment Date: October 13th

# Purpose
\
The first Homework assignment using JavaScript for the UC Berkeley Coding BootCamp - Week Three. This is a short game to understand how to create a game using JavaScript, HTML and Bootstrap functions. In this game I focused on the functionality rather than the esthetics of the game, which I later plan to edit. 

The Psychic-Game is a short and interactive game between the user and a computer. When the "click to play" button is clicked, the user gets 10 chances to try guess which number the computer randomely generates. If the user gets it right, they win.
